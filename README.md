# TCR_diversity
Functions for preprocessing and downstream analysis of TCR sequencing data obtained with Adaptive Biotechnology.

## PreProcessing
File PreProcessing_human allows for dataset filtration, focusing on functional genes only.

## Subsampling for file reconstitution regarding CD4/CD8 ratio
Samples obtained separately for CD4+ and CD8+ subsets of cells can be reconstituted to reflect the distribution of sequences obtained for blood sample with uncategorized CD4+ and CD8+ cells.
